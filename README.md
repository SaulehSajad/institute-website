Institute Portfolio – ReactJS Project

Description:
The Institute Portfolio is a modern, responsive ReactJS application designed for educational institutes to showcase their courses, faculty, admission process, and contact information. It provides a calm, ethical, and neomorphic design aesthetic using gradients, warm neutrals, and soft shadows for a soothing user experience.

The project dynamically consumes data from a data file (array of objects), making it scalable and easy to maintain. All sections—Navbar, Hero Carousel, Courses, Faculty, Admission, About, Support, and Contact—are generated based on this structured data.

Features:

📌 Dynamic Data Rendering – All content (courses, faculty, hero images, etc.) is loaded from a data file.

🎨 Neomorphic Ethical Layout – Soft shadows, airy gradients, and warm tones for a calm look.

🖼️ Hero Section with Carousel – Multiple images auto-rotate with smooth transitions and manual navigation controls.

📚 Course Showcase – Displays course title, summary, duration, and level dynamically.

👩‍🏫 Faculty Profiles – Highlighted with avatars, designations, and bios.

📝 Admission Section – CTA with details about the admission process.

ℹ️ About Us & Support – Descriptions of institute values and support contact details.

📩 Contact Form – Simple form (demo) for student inquiries, extendable to backend APIs.

📱 Responsive Design – Optimized for desktop and mobile (with hamburger menu for smaller screens).
