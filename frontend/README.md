# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Institute Portfolio – ReactJS Project

Description:
The Institute Portfolio is a modern, responsive ReactJS application designed for educational institutes to showcase their courses, faculty, admission process, and contact information. It provides a calm, ethical, and neomorphic design aesthetic using gradients, warm neutrals, and soft shadows for a soothing user experience.

The project dynamically consumes data from a data file (array of objects), making it scalable and easy to maintain. All sections—Navbar, Hero Carousel, Courses, Faculty, Admission, About, Support, and Contact—are generated based on this structured data.

Features:

📌 Dynamic Data Rendering – All content (courses, faculty, hero images, etc.) is loaded from a data file.

🎨 Neomorphic Ethical Layout – Soft shadows, airy gradients, and warm tones for a calm look.

🖼️ Hero Section with Carousel – Multiple images auto-rotate with smooth transitions and manual navigation controls.

📚 Course Showcase – Displays course title, summary, duration, and level dynamically.

👩‍🏫 Faculty Profiles – Highlighted with avatars, designations, and bios.

📝 Admission Section – CTA with details about the admission process.

ℹ️ About Us & Support – Descriptions of institute values and support contact details.

📩 Contact Form – Simple form (demo) for student inquiries, extendable to backend APIs.

📱 Responsive Design – Optimized for desktop and mobile (with hamburger menu for smaller screens).
